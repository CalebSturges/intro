# Welcome to CS510 at Chapman University
This is an introductory repository that contains useful learning material

First skim this introduction to **git** that explains why you should use it:

* [About version control](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
* [Learning git](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/git/)

Next complete the following simulated tutorial to get a feel for how **git** works in practice:
* [Git in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

The following "cheat sheet" will be helpful in the future:
* [Git Cheat Sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)

The following link may help setting up your own personal **GitHub** account:

* [Setting up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

Once you have your own **GitHub** account, fork this CS510 repository there, according to:

* [Forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

This readme is written in the **Markdown** markup language. You can learn **Markdown** quickly below:

* [MarkDown](learnmarkdown.md)

**Markdown** is perfectly adequate for simple documentation tasks. For larger, more formal papers, **LaTeX** is the gold standard:

* [LaTeX](http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/info/latex4wp/latex4wp.pdf)

As seen briefly above, the website [LearnXinYMinutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com) is a generally valuable resource for quickly referencing and mastering syntax for new programming languages. A few more of its more relevant sections have been stored in this **GitHub** repository for quick reference:

* [JSON](learnjson.json) (Structured data file)
* [YAML](learnyaml.yaml) (Cleaner structured data file)
* [Bash](learnbash.sh)   (Primary shell used in UNIX/Linux systems)

Since learning the **Bash** shell will be essential going forward, the following "cheat sheet" will be helpful:

* [Bash Cheat Sheet](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf)
